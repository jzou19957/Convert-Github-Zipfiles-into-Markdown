# Convert-Github-Zipfiles-into-Markdown
This code will convert any zip files in the same directory into a single Markdown file and move the zip file and the Markdown file to a folder with the latest modified date as a suffix. This code is intended to help quickly create a Markdown file for any GitHub folder so that users can copy and paste the Markdown into an LLM for learning.
